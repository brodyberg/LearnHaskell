1. 

stack new simpleBuild yesod-sqlite && cd simpleBuild
stack build
stack exec -- yesod devel 

failed with Error yesod has been compiled with a different version
please re-install yesod-bin

but it also said: 

Warning: The package list for 'hackage.haskell.org' is 15 days old.
Run 'cabal update' to get the latest list of available packages.

so I am doing that and retrying... 

same yesod problem... 

2.

stack new fullBuild yesod-sqlite && cd simpleBuild
stack build yesod-bin cabal-install --install-ghc
stack exec -- yesod devel 

THIS WORKS AND DEVEL WILL RELOAD WHEN FILES CHANGE TO RECOMPILE

and there's a note in DevelMain.hs talking about how to get "foreign" cabal 
to work, with a link to here: https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/wiki/ghci

3. 

stack new fullBuild2 yesod-sqlite && cd fullBuild2
stack build
stack exec -- yesod devel
fails with yesod version difference
stack build yesod-bin cabal-install --install-ghc
stack exec -- yesod devel
WORKS but builds full app after discovering it's been invoked
- what is stack build doing for us then? building something else?

ok, so 
stack clean -- removes build
stack build -- full build
stack clean -- removes what we just built
stack build -- full build
