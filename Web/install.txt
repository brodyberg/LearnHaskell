which is confusing since these errors are exactly why the 
author told us to use quickstart...

so I am going to HelloWorld/ and running
stack build 
to see what happens

After I ran stack build, i did a dir /s /b for HelloWorld.exe
I found it in two places: 

C:\Users\brodyberg\Desktop\HelloWorld>dir /s /b HelloWorld.exe
C:\Users\brodyberg\Desktop\HelloWorld\.stack-work\dist\b7fec021\build\HelloWorld\HelloWorld.exe
C:\Users\brodyberg\Desktop\HelloWorld\.stack-work\install\35bf466f\bin\HelloWorld.exe

I just picked one and ran it: 

C:\Users\brodyberg\Desktop\HelloWorld>.stack-work\install\35bf466f\bin\HelloWorld.exe

This completely works

Questions: 
- Is this retail or debug?
- Is this how we'd run on a server? (start the exe?)
- How do I run a simple hs file?
- Why can't 'runhaskell' find imports?
- Why are the docs so useless for windows?
